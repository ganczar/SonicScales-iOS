## SonicScales
The application analyses the sound that is generated by the string, which, depending on the weight, has a different tension, resulting in a different pitch. The application calculates the weight based on the frequency of the sound wave according to the rules of physics, taking into account the parameters of the scale: the length of the arms, the length and diameter of the string, and the material from which it is made.

## Physics of a string
### Wave
The speed of propagation of a wave in a string is proportional to the square root of the string's tension and inversely proportional to the square root of its linear density.

### Frequency
Once the speed of propagation is known, the frequency of the sound produced by the string can be calculated.

### Mass
If you know the length and the diameter of the string, the material from which it is made and the frequency of the sound, you can find the mass of the object being weighed.
